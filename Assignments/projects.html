    <h3>Project 1: Hangman </h3>
    <p>In this project I made a hangman game in Python. The game displayed a number of spaces, indicating how many letters would be in the guessing word. The player would be able to guess one letter at a time until they guess the word. If the guessed letter is wrong, it would be displayed and a limb would b shown. If the guessed letter is correct, it would fill in the space of the guessing word.  </p>
    <h3>Project 2: Calculator </h3>
    <p>This project I also made in python. Users were allowed to type in numbers through 1-9 and 0 and choose an arithmetic formulation to their liking. These arithmetic formulations including multiplication, division, addition and subtraction. The program would then print out the calculated number. </p>
